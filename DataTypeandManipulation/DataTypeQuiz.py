#Which statement is incorrect?
# 932 is Integer
# "False" is Boolean
# 857.25 is Float
# "523" is String

# Solution "False" is Boolean - > Booleans are either True or False, they don't have quotation marks around them, otherwise it would turn them into a String. So it should be bool = False

#What is the data type of the mystery variable?
mystery = 734_529.678
#String, Integer, Float, Boolean

#solution:
#  Even though the underscore is there to make the large number more readable, because there is a decimal point it is still a Float. If you printed the number in your code, it would be stripped down to 734529.678

# I've put a spell on you. You are now a computer. If I give you the following code, what will you print out?
street_name = "Abbey Road"
print(street_name[4] + street_name[7])
# er,en,yo
