# Program waits for the user to enter input in the consle. The program is temporily halted until the user press

name=input("What is your name?")

#-> This is replaced with input data given by the user
# for example if the input is Pravin, Pravin is replaced with input("What is your name?")  and gets assigned in name
#input will get user input in the console
#print  will print  "Hello " and the user input
print ("Hello"+input("What is your name?") )
