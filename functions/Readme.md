 Functions are a really handy way of taking a complex set of instructions and packaging them together inside a block of cod that has a name given to it. And when we need all of the lines of code that's packaged inside this
function,all we have to do at any point later on in our code is just to call the function by typing its name and then a set of parentheses. And when this line of code is run,it's going to search for where this function is defined, which is up here, and then it's going to execute all the lines of code that are contained within

#Defininig function
