Randomization - really important when you are playing game. 
ex-Tetris game
Random Process are non-deterministic since they are impossible to determine  in advance
computer machines-deterministic Randomization .Their operation is predictable and repeatable.
whole bunch of maths -Psuedo Randomization
sampling of big set of deterministic random numbers 
Python uses Mersenne_Twister to generate random number .
